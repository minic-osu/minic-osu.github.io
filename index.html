<br><br>
Redesigning interfaces is my passion. I love the challenge a pages content and layout brings and the possibilities it presents. 
<br><br>
I’m currently working on research that focuses on creating gender-inclusive software and am working on a minor in psychology. My interest in design comes from my love of psychology and how the human mind thinks and processes information. Technology has brought our modern world many great endeavors yet holds the potential for much more. Technology can make our world better only if others can make use of it. Thus, I’ve made it my mission to aid in the creation of usable and inclusive technology, making sure no group is left behind and everyone benefits equally from the advancements in technology. 
<br><br>
I’ve worked as a UX designer and have had the opportunity to spread UX knowledge and show a company the value of providing a better user experience for their costumers. In my portfolio you’ll find documentation, and reports I’ve written about UX techniques and designs. I enjoy teaching others about UX design, I’ve mentored and taught lectures on UX design, and have truly changed others outlook on what is UX design and it’s importance in our world of technology.
