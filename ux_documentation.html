Wrote the documentation for a style guide used throughout the company's main product for T-Mobile. The style guide was written by me and is partially based on the T-Mobile style guide. Many of the styles used by T-mobile did not match the UI-Kit being used, thus many components I assigned their meaning in order to maintain consistency. The documentation here was used my the developers on this product, and is still used to this day.

I created this checklist for any developer building components based on my mock-ups. This document was meant as a quick resource so that they could confirm guidelines had been followed. I also strongly encouraged Quality Assurance to make use of this list when approving a change made by a developer.

                A report I created for an application called Crossroads. This helped indicate the usability flaws within the application and possible solutions to each issue I identified. I worked on this on my own. This document helped me present my UX knowledge to the company and later allowed for my involvement in other projects in the company.

  Document I wrote up as a guide to the business analysts to use when discussing requested features with customers. The information they should be gathering and questions they should be asking, in order to provide the feature in a user friendly way.
